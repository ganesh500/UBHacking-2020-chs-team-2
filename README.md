# UBHacking-2020-chs-team-2
Worked on the frontend and backend of the web application using Flask. Pretty difficult as it was my first time using flask and had only spent a few hours in one night learning it. Errors all over my code but hope to fix them another time. This was my submission for UB Hacking 2020.
